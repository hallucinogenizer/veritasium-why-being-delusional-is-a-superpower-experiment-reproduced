# Luck vs Skill — experiment reproduction

This repository reproduces the experiment mentioned in Veritasium's video (see 03:35 timestamp) where a tournament-style selection is run on many randomly-generated players to show how much "luck" contributes to the top performers when skill is the dominant factor.

Summary
-------

The code simulates many rounds. Each round:

- generates 20,000 players with random `skill` and `luck` values (integers roughly 0–100),
- computes a weighted score for each player using 95% skill and 5% luck,
- selects the top 10 players by that score,
- records the average skill and average luck of those top 10 players.

This process repeats for a number of rounds (1,000 by default) and prints the overall average luck and skill of the top-10 winners across all rounds.

Video reference
---------------

- Veritasium — the experiment is discussed at ~03:35 in the video: https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I?si=Y6eLEHEywqJ9ChdV

What the code shows
-------------------

- Because skill contributes 95% of each player's score, the top-10 winners will usually have very high skill on average.
- However, even a small contribution from luck (5%) can still affect which individuals end up in the top-10, and you'll typically see a non-zero average luck among winners. The experiment quantifies that effect across many trials.

Files
-----

- `src/experiment.ts` — the full simulation. Key parameters are near the top of the file (number of players, rounds, weights).
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies. The project uses `cli-progress` to show a progress bar while simulating.

Quick start
-----------

Requirements

- Node.js (recommended >= 16)
- pnpm (project uses pnpm in package metadata, but npm/yarn will also work)

Install and run

```bash
# From the repository root
pnpm install
pnpm start

# Or during development with auto-reload on file changes:
pnpm run dev
```

What you'll see
---------------

While the simulation runs you'll see a progress bar. When finished the script prints two numbers: the overall average luck of the top-10 winners and the overall average skill of the top-10 winners (both rounded).

Example (annotated) output

```
After 1000 simulations of 20,000 players each, average luck of top 10 winners:
7
After 1000 simulations of 20,000 players each, average skill of top 10 winners:
95
```

Interpretation: in this contrived example (weights and ranges used in the code), winners have very high average skill (near the top of the 0–100 range), and a smaller but non-zero average luck value.

Contract (tiny)
----------------

- Inputs: none (script generates random players).
- Outputs: printed averages (average luck and average skill of top-10 winners across all simulated rounds).
- Error modes: the script handles empty arrays defensively and will return 0 averages if there are no winners; normal usage generates players so this shouldn't be triggered.

Edge cases
----------

- If you change the number of players to fewer than 10, the script will still slice and return whatever players exist (so top-N may be smaller than 10).
- `skill` and `luck` are generated with `Math.round(Math.random() * 100)`, so they can be 0 and 100 inclusive.

How to modify the experiment
----------------------------

- Change the number of players generated by editing `generate20kPlayers()` (or rename it and its count) in `src/experiment.ts`.
- Change the number of rounds by modifying the `rounds` variable near the bottom of `src/experiment.ts`.
- Change the weighting between skill and luck inside `find10Winners()` by altering the weights used when computing `score`.

Ideas / next steps
------------------

- Collect distributions (histograms) of winner skill and luck and visualize them.
- Try different weightings (e.g., 50/50, 80/20, 99/1) to see how the role of luck changes.
- Run larger simulations or vary player population sizes to observe scaling effects.
